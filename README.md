Operator Precedence


3. Control Statements

if, if-else, if-else-if

Nested if statements

switch statement

goto statement

Loops: for, while, do-while

break & continue


4. Functions

Function declaration & definition

Function parameters & return values

Default arguments

Inline functions

6. Pointers

Pointer basics

Pointer arithmetic

Pointers & arrays

Pointers to functions

References

Dynamic memory allocation (new, delete)


7. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Classes & Objects

Access specifiers (public, private, protected)

Constructors & Destructors

Set / Multiset

Map / Multimap


Iterators

Algorithms (sort, find, count, etc.)

Pairs & Tuples


9. File Handling

File input & output

ifstream, ofstream, fstream

Reading & writing files

File modes


10. Miscellaneous

Enumerations (enum)

Type aliases (typedef, using)

Namespaces

Preprocessor directives (#define, #include, #ifdef)
